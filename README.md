# AE Script UI Wrapper
**Description:** A self-contained wrapper that creates a ScriptUI panel in After Effects. Automatically handles both dockable panels (when placed in the ScriptUI Panels folder) and floating windows (when run as a regular script).

**Replace** *"My Script Name (add Your Script Name Here)"* on line 15 with the name of your script.

***Warning:** This script uses ExtendScript, which Adobe is gradually phasing out. Future compatibility may be limited.*
