# AE Script UI Wrapper
**Description:** A self-contained wrapper that creates a ScriptUI panel in After Effects. Automatically handles both dockable panels (when placed in the ScriptUI Panels folder) and floating windows (when run as a regular script).
**Warning:** This script uses ExtendScript, which Adobe is gradually phasing out. Future compatibility may be limited.
